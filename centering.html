		<div style="position: relative; top: 20%; border:5px solid red;  margin: 0 auto; height: 200px; width:200px">
			<p>in the CSS the border is just to see where the div is, and the hight and width are just to give it a shape.</p>
			
			<p>try to understand the way "position: relative; top: 20%" works and the way "margin: 0 auto" works</p>
